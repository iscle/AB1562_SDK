/**
 * @addtogroup HAL
 * @{
 * @addtogroup CACHE
 * @{
 * This section describes the programming interfaces of the CACHE controller.
 * There are two CACHE controllers (I-CACHE and D-CACHE) that allow the user to set the CACHE size, configure the cacheable region(s), enable or disable the CACHE and to perform CACHE maintenance operations, such as invalidate and flush. These maintenance operations may be performed on the entire CACHE or based on the given address and length.\n
 * Most of CACHE APIs will effect I-CACHE and D-CACHE at the same time.\n
 * When a memory is set as cacheable, the CPU exchanges data with the CACHE memory during the CACHE hit instead of an external memory, so it can accelerate the access performance. But a data coherency
 * issue is possible when the memory is shared between the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and hardware co-processors, such as Direct Memory Access (DMA). Peripherals (Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C), Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART), Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)) or hardware modules (Graphics 2D (G2D), CAMERA) that operate
 * in DMA mode also face the same issue.\n
 * These peripherals or hardware modules must work with non-cacheable memory.
 * @section HAL_CACHE_Terms_Chapter Terms and acronyms
 *
 * The following provides descriptions to the terms commonly used in the CACHE controller and how to use its various functions.
 *
 * |Terms                   |Details                                                                 |
 * |------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * |\b AHB                        | Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB) is a bus protocol introduced in the <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ihi0011a/index.html">Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture version 2</a> published by ARM Ltd.|
 * |\b CACHE                      | A collection of data duplicating original values stored in external memory, to accelerate the data access and enhance the MCU performance.|
 * |\b CACHE line                 | The smallest unit of memory that can be transferred between the main memory and the CACHE. Unless otherwise indicated, the CACHE line size is 8 words (64 bytes).|
 * |\b IRAM                       | Local Instruction Memory (TCM), memory which resides directly in the processor.|
 * |\b DRAM                       | Local Data Memory (TCM), memory which resides directly in the processor.|
 * |\b flush                      | Data in invalid CACHE line with dirty bit set is evicted to write-back buffer, then dirty bits are cleared. If the entry is invalid or the dirty flag is not set, leave as it is. The action does not clear the valid bit(s).|
 * |\b invalidate                 | Unconditionally clear valid and dirty bits of the corresponding CACHE line(s).|
 *
 * @section HAL_CACHE_Features_Chapter Supported features
 * Features supported by this module are listed below:
 *
 * - \b Configure \b the \b overall \b CACHE \b size.\n
 *   To reach the optimum system performance, the CACHE size can be set with flexibility. If the CACHE size is not set to the maximum (32kB), the memory of the unused CACHE is reused by the TCM.
 *   Users can call the function #hal_cache_set_size(), to set the CACHE size. The input parameter of this function can be any value of type #hal_cache_size_t.
 *   Apply different parameters for the function #hal_cache_set_size() to set the cache size to one of the following four configurations:
 *      |Parameter             | CACHE size     |
 *      |----------------------|----------------|
 *      | #HAL_CACHE_SIZE_16KB | 16kB           |
 *
 * - \b Using \b CACHE \b region \b to \b set \b a \b cacheable \b attribute \b for \b a \b memory \b block.\n
 *   The CACHE controller has 8 regions for cacheable attribute settings. Note that each region can be continuous or non-continuous to each other. For those address ranges not covered by any region in the CACHE, the cacheable settings are automatically set as uncacheable. There is one restriction: different regions must not overlap.
 *   Call the function #hal_cache_region_config(), to set the cacheable memory blocks for each region. The parameter should be of type #hal_cache_region_config_t and the field in the #hal_cache_region_config_t includes the cache_region_address (must be 512MB aligned) and the cache_region_size (must be 512MB aligned).\n
 *
 * - \b CACHE \b flush \b or \b invalidate \b operation. \n
 *   The CACHE maintenance operation includes flush and invalidate. The two operations may be performed on the entire CACHE or on a given address-length. The CACHE driver API names distinguish one from the other by the word "all". For example, to invalidate all CACHE lines, call the API #hal_cache_invalidate_all_cache_lines(). To invalidate the CACHE lines for a particular memory block, simply call #hal_cache_invalidate_multiple_cache_lines(). Note that the parameters "address" and "length" must be supplied to specify the physical address range to perform the CACHE maintenance operation on. The usage of flush operation is the same as the invalidate operation.
 *
 *
 * @section HAL_CACHE_Driver_Usage_Chapter How to use this driver
 *
 * - \b Use \b CACHE \b driver \b to \b enable \b or \b disable \b CACHE.
 *  - #hal_cache_region_enable() or #hal_cache_region_disable() is used to enable or disable cacheable attribute for a specified region.
 *  - #hal_cache_enable() or #hal_cache_disable() is used to enable or disable the CACHE controller. If disabled, the MCU memory accesses are all non-cacheable. If enabled, the settings in CACHE controller will take effect.
 *
 * - \b Use \b CACHE \b driver \b to \b set \b a \b cacheable \b region.
 *  - Step 1. Call #hal_cache_set_size() to set the total CACHE size.
 *  - Step 2. Call #hal_cache_region_config() to set a CACHE region with specified address and length (should call more than once if there are multiple regions to be configured as cacheable).
 *  - Step 3. Call #hal_cache_region_enable() to enable the CACHE function of the corresponding region configured in step 2.
 *  - Step 4. Call #hal_cache_enable() to enable the CACHE controller.
 *  - Sample code:
 *  @code
 *
 *  hal_cache_region_t region = HAL_CACHE_REGION_0;
 *  hal_cache_region_config_t region_config;
 *
 *  hal_cache_set_size(HAL_CACHE_SIZE_16K); // Set the total CACHE size. It only support HAL_CACHE_SIZE_16K
 *
 *  region_config.cache_region_address = 0x00000000; // The start address of the region that is cacheable, which must be 512MB aligned.
 *  region_config.cache_region_size = 0x20000000; // The size of the cacheable region, which must be 512MB.
 *
 *  hal_cache_region_config(region, &region_config);
 *  hal_cache_region_enable(region);
 *
 *  hal_cache_enable();
 *  @endcode
 *
 * - \b Use \b CACHE \b driver \b to \b flush \b or \b invalidate \b a \b cacheable \b region.\n
 *   - Step 1.\n
 *        Call #hal_cache_flush_multiple_cache_lines() to flush a cacheable memory specified by address and length.
 *  \n    Call #hal_cache_flush_one_cache_line() instead, if just one line needs to be flushed.
 *   - Step 2.\n
 *        Call #hal_cache_invalidate_multiple_cache_lines() to invalidate a cacheable memory specified by address and length.
 *  \n    Call #hal_cache_invalidate_one_cache_line() instead, if just one line needs to be invalidated.
 *   - Sample code:
 *   @code
 *
 *  hal_cache_region_t region = HAL_CACHE_REGION_0;
 *  hal_cache_region_config_t region_config;
 *
 *  hal_cache_set_size(HAL_CACHE_SIZE_16K); // Set the total CACHE size. It only support HAL_CACHE_SIZE_16K.
 *
 *  region_config.cache_region_address = 0x00000000; // The start address of the region that is cacheable, that must be 512MB aligned.
 *  region_config.cache_region_size = 0x20000000; // The size of the cacheable region, which must be 512MB.
 *
 *  hal_cache_region_config(region, &region_config);
 *  hal_cache_region_enable(region);
 *
 *  hal_cache_enable();
 *
 *  hal_cache_flush_multiple_cache_lines(region_config.cache_region_address, region_config.cache_size);
 *  hal_cache_invalidate_multiple_cache_lines(region_config.cache_region_address, region_config.cache_size);
 *  @endcode
 *
 * - \b Use \b CACHE \b driver \b to \b flush \b or \b invalidate \b all \b cacheable \b regions. \n
 *   - Step 1. Call #hal_cache_flush_all_cache_lines().
 *   - Step 2. Call #hal_cache_invalidate_all_cache_lines().
