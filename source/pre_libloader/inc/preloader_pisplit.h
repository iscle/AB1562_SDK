 * @section Perloader_Pisplit_Features_Chapter Supported features
 * Preloader diagram as below:
 * @image html preloader_Standard_PIC_solution_introduction.png
 * Features supported by this module are listed below:
 * - \b Position-Independent \b Libraries.\n
 *   The Position-Independent Libraries feature is Cadence standard service,please reference Cadence document of "Xtensa System Software Reference Manual.pdf", as the chapter of "4.3 Position-Independent Libraries" description:\n
 *   "A position-independent library can be loaded and run at any address that supports both code and data, like normal system RAM. Alternatively,you can use the pisplitload LSP to load code and data into separate memory blocks in the local RAM.
. It is not necessary to decide on the location of the library until run time. Because their locations are not fixed, a variety of position-independent libraries can be loaded at the same time, without deciding at build time which sets are possible. For example, if you have five codecs, and three can be loaded at the same time, then they could be loaded in ten different combinations, which is too many to feasibly link in fixed-locations. Position-independent libraries solve that problem by allowing the codecs to be loaded in arbitrary locations and in an arbitrary order."\n
 *     \b Advantages:
 *              Flexibility: Several dynamic location libraries can be loaded in arbitrary combinations at arbitrary locations,
 *                  all of which is decided at run-time.\n
 *     \b Disadvantages:
 *              Performance: A position-independent library must be compiled as position-independent code.
 *                  This is marginally slower than position-dependent code.\n
 * - \b Preloader \b Position-Independent \b Libraries .\n
 *   We provide a mechanism to load pisplit libraries by DMA. Because loading a library image from Flash to DSP local memory need takes time,
 *      you can load the libraries in advance. It invokes a callback function to notify that that load is complete.\n
 *   To use this mechanism, you can save MCU MIPS and speed up the action of loading libraries.
 * @section Perloader_Pisplit_Memory_Chapter The Required Resources of the Preloader
 * - \b Pisplit \b libraries \b build \b environment.\n
 *         The pisplit libraries build another set of things that are different to the set built by the main program.
 *              These types of libraries must be built with the compile option of "-fpic".
 *              The reference makefile of "dsp\project\mt2811a_evb\templates\dsp_pisplit_library_build_demo\dsp0\Makefile";
 *              Please first clone this file when you create your own library.\n
 * - \b Main \b program \b link \b the \b pisplit \b libraries.\n
 *         The main program must be linked with the pisplit library during the link stage.
 *              The pisplit library is different to the general library because its library's symbol is invisible to the main program,
 *              it is simply a large array to the main program.\n
 * - \b The \b memory \b of \b dynamic \b allocate \b by \b main \b program.\n
 *         DSP must have a dynamically allocated mechanism because runtime is necessary for loading the piplit library to run.
 *              We use DSP local memory of I/D RAM as the relocation memory in our DSP SDK reference design. The reference projects will use all the free memory of I/D RAM.\n
 * - \b Pre-load \b image.\n
 *         Cadence provides the basic service for loading and relocating the pisplit libraries.
 *              The DMA service is necessary because the preloader modifies some of the Cadence service to implement a mechanism of using DMA to do libraries image copy.\n
 * - \b The \b parameters \b transfer \b between \b main \b program \b and \b pisplit \b libraries.\n
 *         The export parameters transfer to main program by pisplit libraries. For example, the pisplit library entry functions must be transferred to the main program,
 *              to make sure the library can be correctly called by the main program after it has loaded.\n
 *         The import parameters transfer to pisplit libraries by the main program. For example, the pisplit library maybe need to call some basic functions or data defined by main program.
 *              You can then transfer it as import parameters. Just use Type Cast to use these symbols in the library.\n
 * @section Perloader_Pisplit_Library_Build_Chapter How to build pisplit libraries
 * - \b Step 1: Create your library files.\n
 *         Create your pisplit library file like "dsp\project\mt2811a_evb\templates\dsp_pisplit_library_build_demo\dsp0\src\lib_main.c".\n
 * @code
 * //this is pisplit library code
 *#include <stdio.h>
 * typedef int (*printf_ptr_t)(const char *format, ...);
 *
 * printf_ptr_t printf_ptr;
 *
 * #define printf printf_ptr
 *
 * char * dsp0_demo_lib_entry_1(void)
 * {
 *  printf("executing function dsp0_demo_lib_entry_1\n");
 *  return "this string returned from dsp0_demo_lib_entry_1";
 * }
 * char * dsp0_demo_lib_entry_2(void)
 * {
 *  printf("executing function dsp0_demo_lib_entry_2\n");
 *  return "this string returned from dsp0_demo_lib_entry_2";
 * }
 * char * dsp0_demo_lib_entry_3(void)
 * {
 *  printf("executing function dsp0_demo_lib_entry_3\n");
 *  return "this string returned from dsp0_demo_lib_entry_3";
 * }
 *
 * void * export_parameter_array[3] = {dsp0_demo_lib_entry_1,dsp0_demo_lib_entry_2,dsp0_demo_lib_entry_3};
 *
 * void * _start (void *p_import_parameters_array[])
 * {
 *  printf_ptr = p_import_parameters_array[0];
 *  printf("dsp0_demo_lib_entry_1:0x%x   dsp0_demo_lib_entry_2:0x%x   dsp0_demo_lib_entry_3:0x%x",dsp0_demo_lib_entry_1,dsp0_demo_lib_entry_2,dsp0_demo_lib_entry_3);
 *  return export_parameter_array;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *         Please pay attention to the following three points:\n
 *         1. Pisplit library is a stand-alone build system. Please do not reference any symbols defined by other libraries, including the C library.
 *         2. The export parameters to the main program must be prepared , the same as the sample code symbol of "dsp0_demo_lib_entry_1" and "dsp0_demo_lib_entry_2" and "dsp0_demo_lib_entry_3",
 *          the function of "_start" will return the address of "export_parameter_array" to main program. The main program then knows the entry of the library. You can even let the the function of "_start" return a array address which stores more functions or data point, 
then the main program can get more entries of this library.\n
 *         3. The import parameters to the library must be prepared. The sample code symbol of "printf_func", 
 *          the function of "_start" can import a parameter when called by the main program. You can import a parameter of the function of "_start" with an array address which stores more functions or data points, then the library can get more import parameters defined by the main program.\n
 * - \b Setp 2: Prepare a pisplit library build system.\n
 *         You must first clone the makefile of "dsp\project\mt2811a_evb\templates\dsp_pisplit_library_build_demo\dsp0\Makefile", then you should make changes for your library:\n
 *         1. Modify the path of depth, such as the "ROOTDIR" as shown in the following sample code:
 * @code
 *  # module makefile settings
 *  ROOTDIR       :=  ../../../..
 * @endcode
 *         2. Modify your PIC library settings as shown in the following sample code::\n
 *            A. PIC_LIB is the final output file path and name. Please pay specific attention to it. You must also have the xxx.o file when the main program links.\n
 *            B. PIC is your library name. Please pay specific attention to it. You must use this name to load your library on the main program.\n
 *            C. PIC_MODULE_PATH use for identify your library files to build.
 * @code
 *  # PIC settings
 *  PIC      :=  dsp0_pisplit_library_build_demo
 *  # PIC_LIB named better is {PIC}.o
 *  PIC_LIB  :=  $(BUILD_LIBDIR)/dsp0_pisplit_library_build_demo.o
 *  # PIC_DEBUG_LIB named better is {PIC}_position_independent.splitload.lib
 *  PIC_DEBUG_LIB  :=  $(BUILD_LIBDIR)/dsp0_pisplit_library_build_demo_position_independent.splitload.lib
 *  PIC_MODULE_PATH := project/mt2811a_evb/templates/dsp0_pisplit_library_build_demo
 * @endcode
 *            D. Make sure environment variables of DSP core which run the PIC library.\n
 *               Make sure to use "xt-xc++" to link.\n
 *               Make sure some compile options must be include. Like "-g" is for adding debugging information for the library build.\n
 * @code
 *  include $(ROOTDIR)/.config.mk
 *  #if you want to build dsp0 PIC library,please include dsp0 chip.mk, otherwise please use dsp1 chip.mk.
 *  #On dsp0 chip.mk will defined the dsp0 core environment variables,like:"XTENSA_CORE= dsp0_core_winabi_xtensac".
 *  include $(ROOTDIR)/config/chip/mt2811/dsp0/chip.mk
 *  #include $(ROOTDIR)/config/chip/mt2811/dsp0/chip.mk
 *
 *  # Compile option settings
 *  LD = xt-xc++
 *  CFLAGS  +=  -O2 -Wall -g  -mlongcalls -fmessage-length=0
 * @endcode
 *            E. Add your source file to build, as shown below:
 *              C_SRC for adding your xxx.c files, and ASM_SRC for adding your xxx.s files.INC for adding your header file path.\n
 * @code
 *  # Source file settings
 *  C_SRC  +=  $(strip $(PIC_MODULE_PATH))/src/lib_main.c
 *  ASM_SRC      +=
 *  # Include path settings
 *  INC  +=  $(strip $(PIC_MODULE_PATH))/inc
 * @endcode
 *              If your PIC library also need to include some static library files, for example xa_aac_loas_dec.a as shown below :
 * @code
 * # .o objects & .d dependency list
 * PICSL_LIBRARY_OBJS = $(C_SRC:%.c=$(OUTDIR)/%.picsl.o)
 * PICSL_LIBRARY_OBJS += $(ASM_SRC:%.S=$(OUTDIR)/%.picsl.o)
 * # Please add this line to here.
 * PICSL_LIBRARY_OBJS += $(ROOTDIR)/xxxxxx/xa_aac_loas_dec.a
 * @endcode
 *            F. There are three actions for this step. It is not necessary to use modify.\n
 *                  First, build your xxx.c and xxx.s file to obj file.\n
 *                  Next, link all obj files to a lib file, named by "PIC_DEBUG_LIB" in Step C, it and will also generate the library asm file:"{xxx}_position_independent.splitload.lib.asm",also for debug.\n
 *                  Finally, package the loadable library into an object file using the Xtensa tool of xt-pkg-loadlib. This generates the final output filenamed by "PIC_LIB" during Step C.\n
 * @code
 *  all :  $(PIC_LIB)
 *      @echo Build $(PIC_LIB) Done
 *
 *  $(OUTDIR)/%.picsl.o :  $(ROOTDIR)/%.S
 *      @mkdir -p $(dir $@)
 *      $(AS) $(ASFLAG) $(INC:%=-I"$(ROOTDIR)/%") -fpic -o $@ -c $^
 *
 *  $(OUTDIR)/%.picsl.o :  $(ROOTDIR)/%.c
 *      @mkdir -p $(dir $@)
 *      $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(INC:%=-I"$(ROOTDIR)/%") -fpic -o $@ -c $^
 *
 *  $(PIC_DEBUG_LIB) : $(PICSL_LIBRARY_OBJS)
 *      @if [ -e "$@" ]; then rm -f "$@"; fi
 *      @mkdir -p $(dir $@)
 *      $(LD) $(CFLAGS) -mlsp=pisplitload -Wl,--shared-pagesize=128  $^ \ -Wl,-pie -o $@
 *      @$(OBJDUMP) -d $@ > $@.asm
 *
 *  $(PIC_LIB) : $(PIC_DEBUG_LIB)
 *      @if [ -e "$@" ]; then rm -f "$@"; fi
 *      @mkdir -p $(dir $@)
 *      xt-pkg-loadlib -p -e $(PIC) -o $@ $^
 * @endcode
 *                  Note: After library built will generate the three files under path of "dsp\project\mt2811a_evb\templates\dsp_pisplit_library_build_demo\dsp0\Build\lib". these are very important:\n
 *                          - The <xxx.o> file need to link with main program.\n
 *                          - The <xxx_position_independent.splitload.lib> file is for online and offline debug.\n
 *                          - The <xxx_position_independent.splitload.lib.asm> file is the library assembly code, also for debug.\n
 *                          please keep and provide them when debug library. For AAC library as example,
 *                          Airoha had put the three files in the path of “dsp/prebuilt/middleware/dspalg/third_party/aac_decoder/pisplit”.\n
 * - \b Step 3: You can now build your library and change directory to the makefile path to use the "make" command to build. You must first "make clean".\n
 * - \b Step 4: Linking the pisplit library with main program.\n
 *          Firstly, user should makesure "PRELOADER_ENABLE = y" on by project file of feature.mk, like "dsp\project\mt2811a_evb\templates\dsp0_freertos_create_thread\XT-XCC\feature.mk".
 *          Then user should add "kernel/service/pre_libloader/dsp0/module.mk" to the by project file of Makefile.
 *          Please refer to the template of "dsp\project\mt2811a_evb\templates\dsp0_freertos_create_thread\XT-XCC\Makefile",
 *          add your library xxx.o as shown below:\n
 * @code
 *   include $(ROOTDIR)/kernel/service/pre_libloader/dsp0/module.mk
 *  ################################################################################
 *  # PIC lib# User can also add the dsp0_pisplit_library_build_demo.o in your owner module.mk, and include the sub module.mk on your Makefile
 *  # tempate of "dsp\kernel\service\pre_libloader\dsp0\dsp0_pic_demo_portable\module.mk".
 *  ###############################################################################
 *  PIC     += $(ROOTDIR)/project/mt2811a_evb/templates/dsp_pisplit_library_build_demo/dsp0/Build/lib/dsp0_pisplit_library_build_demo.o
 *  PIC     += $(ROOTDIR)/project/mt2811a_evb/templates/dsp_pisplit_library_build_demo/dsp1/Build/lib/dsp1_pisplit_library_build_demo.o
 *  ###############################################################################
 *
 *  PROJ_C_SRC   +=  $(strip $(PROJ_PATH))/src/preloader_pisplit_configure.c
 * @endcode
 * - \b Step 5: Start to run(please refer the chapter of How to use preloader of pisplit drivers).\n
 * @section Perloader_Pisplit_Library_Driver_Chapter How to use preloader of pisplit drivers
 * Diagram as below:
 * @image html preloader_How_to_run_PIC_library_single_core.png
 * - \b Step 1: You should add your pisplit library to the main program in this step. Please create preloader configure files in your project path. Please refer to "dsp\project\mt2811a_evb\templates\dsp0_freertos_create_thread\inc\preloader_pisplit_configure.h","dsp\project\mt2811a_evb\templates\dsp0_freertos_create_thread\src\preloader_pisplit_configure.c" and make the following changes:\n
 *          1. Define memory for pisplit libraries. On our SDK reference design, will use DSP local I/D RAM free memory for pisplit libraries. 
 *             User also can define others memory pools for pisplit libraries, for example,there is a sysram free memory pool, user can define it on preloader_pisplit_configure.c.\n
 * @code
 *  //this is the main program preloader_pisplit_configure.c
 * preloader_pisplit_pool_info_t preloader_pisplit_customer_static_pools[] =
 * {
 *     {//SYSRAM   Just a sample, sysram both can run code and data, so can define the type is PRELOADER_I_LOW_PERFORMANCE|PRELOADER_D_LOW_PERFORMANCE.
 *         sysram_for_pisplit_start,
 *         sysram_for_pisplit_end,
 *         PRELOADER_I_LOW_PERFORMANCE|PRELOADER_D_LOW_PERFORMANCE
 *     },
 *     {//PSRAM    Just a sample, psram both can run code and data, so can define the type is PRELOADER_I_LOW_PERFORMANCE|PRELOADER_D_LOW_PERFORMANCE.
 *         psram_for_pisplit_start,
 *         psram_for_pisplit_end,
 *         PRELOADER_I_LOW_PERFORMANCE|PRELOADER_D_LOW_PERFORMANCE
 *     },
 *     {//IRAM
 *         (void *)_preloader_pic_iram_start,
 *         (uint32_t)_preloader_pic_iram_end,
 *         PRELOADER_I_HIGH_PERFORMANCE
 *     },
 *     {//DRAM
 *         (void *)_preloader_pic_dram_start,
 *         (uint32_t)_preloader_pic_dram_end,
 *         PRELOADER_D_HIGH_PERFORMANCE
 *     },
 * };
 * @endcode
 *          2. preloader_pisplit_configure.h It's the most important step:\n
 *              Firstly, you should externally define your library name (it was necessary to define it during Chapter of "How to build pisplit libraries" Step 2.2.C).\n
 *              Secondly, you should add your library name to the Macro of "PIC_LIB_LIST".
 * @code
 *  //this is main program code
 *  extern xtlib_packaged_library dsp0_pisplit_library_build_demo;// user must be external to your library to here!
 *  extern xtlib_packaged_library dsp1_pisplit_library_build_demo;// user must be external to your library to here! this is DSP1 PIC library,just for DSP0 help to load DSP1 library to run.
 *  // user must add your library to this location!
 *  #define PIC_LIB_LIST    { \
 *      &dsp0_pisplit_library_build_demo, \
 *      &dsp1_pisplit_library_build_demo,\
 *  }
 * @endcode
 * - \b Step 2: Call #preloader_pisplit_init() fucntion in DSPx initialization stage.\n
 * @code
 *  //this is main program code
 *  preloader_pisplit_error_handling_t err_status;
 *  err_status = preloader_pisplit_init();
 *  if(PRELOADER_PISPLIT_XTLIB_NO_ERR != err_status)
 *  {
 *      printf("preloader_pisplit_init() error code:%d !",err_status);
 *      while(1);
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 * - \b Step 3: Add some memory pools for pisplit libraries.
 * @code
 *  //there is a function of pisplit_configure_static_pool() defined in preloader_pisplit_configure.c. User can call pisplit_configure_static_pool() to add your memory pools.
 * void pisplit_configure_static_pool()
 * {
 *     uint32_t count;
 *     count = sizeof(preloader_pisplit_customer_static_pools)/sizeof(preloader_pisplit_pool_info_t);
 *     preloader_pisplit_add_pools(preloader_pisplit_customer_static_pools,count);
 * }
 * @endcode
 * - \b Step 4: Define the export/import parameters clear.\n
 *              As shown in the description of "How to build pisplit libraries of Step 1.2", you can define your owner type rule of export/import parameters to implement transfer of more than one parameter.\n
 * - \b Step 5: To get handle and load your library to run when you need. Notice:Please call it after DMA init done, better in your task.\n
 *      You must register user callback by the function of #preloader_pisplit_get_handle with the second parameter.
 *      Transfer the import parameters by the function of #preloader_pisplit_load with the second parameter.
 * @code
 *  //this is main program code
 *  void * import_parameter_array[3] = {printf,NULL,NULL};
 *  if(PRELOADER_PISPLIT_XTLIB_NO_ERR != preloader_pisplit_get_handle(&p_dsp_pisplit_library_handle,&dsp0_pisplit_library_build_demo,dsp_pisplit_library_build_demo_callback) )
 *  {
 *      printf("p_dsp_pisplit_library_handle preloader_pisplit_get_handle() error!!!!  err handle:%x",(unsigned int)p_dsp_pisplit_library_handle);
 *      while(1);
 *  }
 *  if(PRELOADER_PISPLIT_XTLIB_NO_ERR != preloader_pisplit_load(p_dsp_pisplit_library_handle,PRELOADER_EXT_IRAM,PRELOADER_EXT_DRAM) )
 *  {
 *      printf("p_dsp_pisplit_library_handle preloader_pisplit_load() error!!!!");
 *      while(1);
 *  }
 * @endcode
 * - \b Step 6: When transfer done will notice to you by your callback function.\n
 * @code
 *  //this is main program code
 * void * import_parameter_array[3] = {printf,NULL,NULL};
 *
 * typedef char * (*p_dsp0_demo_lib_entry_1_t) (void);
 * typedef char * (*p_dsp0_demo_lib_entry_2_t) (void);
 * typedef char * (*p_dsp0_demo_lib_entry_3_t) (void);
 *
 * #define dsp0_demo_lib_entry_1   ((p_dsp0_demo_lib_entry_1_t)dsp0_pisplit_demo_library_export_parameters[0])
 * #define dsp0_demo_lib_entry_2   ((p_dsp0_demo_lib_entry_2_t)dsp0_pisplit_demo_library_export_parameters[1])
 * #define dsp0_demo_lib_entry_3   ((p_dsp0_demo_lib_entry_3_t)dsp0_pisplit_demo_library_export_parameters[2])
 * 
 *
 * preloader_pisplit_handle_t p_dsp_pisplit_library_handle;
 *
 * void dsp_pisplit_library_build_demo_callback(preloader_pisplit_handle_t handle)
 * {
 *   BaseType_t xTaskWokenByPost = pdFALSE;
 *   uint32_t *p_export_parameters;
 *   p_export_parameters = preloader_pisplit_get_export_parameter(handle,import_parameter_array);
 *   dsp0_pisplit_demo_library_export_parameters[0] =(void*)p_export_parameters[0];
 *   dsp0_pisplit_demo_library_export_parameters[1] =(void*)p_export_parameters[1];
 *   dsp0_pisplit_demo_library_export_parameters[2] =(void*)p_export_parameters[2];
 *   xSemaphoreGiveFromISR( dsp0_pisplit_demo_library_xSemaphore, &xHigherPriorityTaskWoken );
 * }
 * @endcode
 * - \b Step 7: Call your PIC library entries in your task after receive the semaphore. Strongly suggest user call your library entry functions on task level,void the IRQ handler execute too long to impact DSP real time performance.\n
 * @code
 *  //this is main program code
 *     dsp0_demo_lib_entry_1();   //call libray entry 1 function
 *     dsp0_demo_lib_entry_2(); //call libray entry 2 function
 *     dsp0_demo_lib_entry_3(); //call libray entry 3 function
 *     //if need, you can do unload for this library to release more memory.
 * @endcode
 * - \b Notice: For easier to switch from PIC library to static libary. User can create a portable layer for every library to replace Step 4~7.
 *              please reference the standard portable example of "dsp\kernel\service\pre_libloader\dsp0\dsp0_pic_demo_portable" .
 *              If defined the option of "DSP0_PISPLIT_DEMO_LIBRARY", will use run this library as PIC mode, otherwise will as static mode.
 *              Strongly suggest user should create your own xxx_lib_portable.h and xxx_lib_portable.c follow the demo.\n

 * The most importance point is that user can use the same function symbol with static library directly, there are advantages:\n
 * 1.  Easier to switch the library from PIC mode to static mode without change any code.
 * 2.  Easy to debug. Can add trace code for library entries functions and send error log when the library not be loaded but the entry have been called.
 * @code

 * // call library entries
 *     dsp0_demo_lib_entry_1();   //call libray entry 1 function

 * @section Perloader_Pisplit_Library_DSP0_Load_DSP1_Chapter The feature of DSP0 help DSP1 to load PIC library
 * If DSP1 just a accelerator for DSP0, and with less memory. Can use this feature which DSP0 help DSP1 to load its PIC library.
 * Then DSP1 can cut down most services like preloader driver and SW DMA driver etc., just use less services of #preloader_pisplit_get_export_parameter to get PIC library parameters when DSP0 load library done.\n
 *  On the other hand, if DSP1 PIC memory pool was DSP1 free memory, so the information just be known until DSP1 boot up. User can use dynamic memory pool features to resolve this problem.\n
 *  Preloader Cross dual cores diagram as below:
 * @image html preloader_Dual_Core_PIC_solution_introduction.png
 *  As below just a example of DSP0 want load libraries to DSP1 I/DRAM memory pools.\n
 * \b Notice1: DSP0 and DSP1 have some communication requirement, please use the module of CCCI. User also can reference the sample file of dsp\project\mt2811a_evb\templates\dsp0_freertos_create_thread\inc\ccci_configure.h
 *  and dsp\project\mt2811a_evb\templates\dsp1_create_message_queue\inc\ccci_configure.h.\n
 * \b Notice2: There is a important information of when DSP0 access DSP1 I/DRAM, must be guarantee DSP1 core be in active state, because when DSP1 enter sleep, will lead DSP0 access DSP1 I/DRAM fail.
 *  And preloader_pisplit driver will do DSP1 DCM and Sleep lock via CCNI when user want to use preloader_pisplit to do load DSP1 library on DSP0 side, so user must guarantee DSP1 had been startup at that time.\n
 *  DSP1 how to run the PIC library diagram as below:
 * @image html preloader_How_to_run_PIC_library_cross_core.png
 * Please reference the sample of "dsp\kernel\service\pre_libloader\dsp0\dsp0_load_dsp1_pic_demo_portable" and "dsp\kernel\service\pre_libloader\dsp1\dsp1_pic_demo_portable".\n
 *         - \b Step 1: Define the CCCI event for cross core communication for the feature of DSP0 help DSP1 to load its PIC library.\n

 * @section Perloader_Pisplit_Library_How_To_Debug_Chapter How to debug pisplit library
 *  Xplorer or Xtensa OCD both support pisplit library debugging and they must both have the library lib file: "dsp\project\mt2811a_evb\templates\dsp_pisplit_library_build_demo\dsp0\Build\lib\dsp0_pisplit_library_build_demo_position_independent.splitload.lib".\n
 * - \b How \b to \b debug \b with \b Xplorer.\n
 *       - \b Step 1: Debug main program success.\n
 *       - \b Step 2: Must get the relocation address of the running library.\n
 *          You can get the address using one of two methods:
 *          1. Refer to the log. When library loaded, the address is sent as "###debug###important info## the (xtlib_pi_library_debug_addr) lib_info.text_addr:0x300410f0". The address of 0x300410f0 is the library relocation address.\n
 *          2. Use online debugging to see the variable of "g_preloader_pisplit_library_info[x].lib_info.text_addr" to get the address.\n
 *       - \b Step 3: Add library debug symbol.\n
 *          1. Select and right click the menu of "Debug Program".\n
 *          2. Select and right click the menu of "Load Alternate Symbols".\n
 *          3. Select and right click the menu of "Select...".\n
 *          @image html preloader_how_to_debug_with_Xplorer_1.png
 *          4. Select the  menu of "Add these new symbols to currently ...".\n
 *          5. Write the running library relocation address.
 *          6. Select the  menu of "Choose from file system" and find the file of xxx_position_independent.splitload.lib.\n
 *          7. Click the button of "OK".\n
 *          @image html preloader_how_to_debug_with_Xplorer_2.png
 *       - \b Step 4: Then your library symbol will be add success.

 * - \b How \b to \b debug \b with \b Xtensa \b OCD.\n
 *      The operations are very similar to the Xplorer procedure. Simply replace the Step 3 to use the cmd of "add-symbol-file Z:\\dsp\\project\\mt2811a_evb\\templates\\dsp_pisplit_library_build_demo\\dsp0\\Build\\lib\\dsp_pisplit_library_build_demo_position_independent.splitload.lib 0x300410f0".\n
